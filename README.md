# Internet
My take on making a virtual internet by putting the theory I learned while studying Computer Networks into code

I will implement a few more protocols then move to transport layer
Implemented DNS and working. Need to fix the return types and structure in almost every protocol.
POP3 classes were fixed. Planning on moving to the next layer.
Also made a tic-tac-toe game based on SHTTP. First use of a custom protocol
