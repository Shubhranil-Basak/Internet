# Internet
My take on making a virtual internet by putting the theory I learned while studying Computer Networks into code

I will implement a few more protocols then move to transport layer
Need to fix POP3 modularization. Skipping IMAP
Implemented DNS and working. Need to fix the return types and structure in almost every protocol.
