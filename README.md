# Internet
My take on making a virtual internet by putting the theory I learned while studying Computer Networks into code

As of now I have just made the basic HTTP communication. I will work a little more on it then move to IP address related stuff
I also made a simple FTP. it can handle text. I will modify it to send byte streams of data to handle any kind of file.
